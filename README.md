# NSW COVID-19 Map

NSW COVID-19 Map is a web app which lets you view the distribution of COVID-19 cases in NSW. It uses [NSW Health data](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/covid-19-cases-by-location), which is provided on a per-postcode level. A range slider lets you see how many cases are near a given suburb.
